# **About**
- Every hostile and neutral mob will get a random item for their armor and hand items
- Armor items can be only pieces of armor, the only exception is the helmet
- Hand items have a high change of being weapons or tools, but they can also be completely random items
- Even hostile and neutral mobs who don't have visual armor when you look at them, they're still equiped with some items
- Every item the mobs are holding have a low chance of being dropped when killed by the player
- Enjoy the randomness
